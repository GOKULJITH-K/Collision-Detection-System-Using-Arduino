# Collision Detection System Using Arduino

In this project, We will show how to design and a build a collision detection system using Arduino,ultrasonic sensor and few other components.This circuit can be used for the collision warning for the vehicles.
We made this system using low cost electronic components such as arduino, resistor, buzzer,led.The main component of the circuit is arduino.When the distance to collision was already set in the program the siren and warning light was activated as a warning to collision. Blue led gives the direction to pay attention and the red light gives the alert for the necessary action also a buzzer is activated when vehicle is close to collision
